## The CAuDri-Challenge
The CAuDri-Challenge aims to provide a community driven platform for students to develop their own autonomous model vehicles and compete in a series of driving challenges.
Each team designs and builds a 1:10 scale autonomous vehicle that is challenged to navigate complex rural and suburban scenarios, adhering to traffic rules, recognizing road signs, obeying speed limits, and maneuvering around obstacles.

Community is our core principle as we seek to connect inspired individuals and let them compete. This challenge is for the students by the students!

### Who is it for?
Everybody is welcome, however typically teams are from european countries and organized at educational institutions e.g. universities or technical colleges. We do not have an age limit and currently do not require any certificate of enrolment, but please refer to the [regulations](/regulations/) for the official requirements.

### Some History
Many of the teams now competing in the CAuDri-Challenge previously took part in the Carolo-Cup which was a similar student competition hosted annually by the *Fakultät für Elektrotechnik, Informationstechnik, Physik* at the *Technische Universität Braunschweig* for many years. Unfortunately, like so many social events, the covid-19 pandemic made it impossible to host a in person competition. After the last in person Carolo-Cup in 2020, the cup took place as an exclusively online event until was discontinued in 2023. 

The event was the motivation for students to spend their little free time on their vehicles, without it we had no reason to continue. At a get together at Ulm University in 2023, experiencing cooperation and competition with like minded students once again - the idea to hold our own competition formed as we decided to take matters in our own hands. 

## The CAuDri e.V.
The CAuDri e.V. ("e. V." meaning *registered association* in German) is the organizer of the CAuDri-Challenge and its the associations purpose to organize the annual challenge. This includes cooperating with teams, institutions and cooperations to host the event, like providing regulated tracks for testing and competing, team ares, prices, moderation and more. Furthermore we want to help new teams on getting started by providing software and hardware resources to lower the beerier of entry.
