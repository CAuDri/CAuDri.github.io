The CAuDri-Challenge aims to provide a platform for students to develop their own autonomous model vehicles and compete in a series of driving challenges. 
Each team will design and build a 1:10 scale autonomous vehicle that can navigate complex rural and suburban scenarios, adhering to traffic rules, recognizing road signs, obeying speed limits, and maneuvering around obstacles.
